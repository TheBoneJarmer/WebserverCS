# WebserverCS
A light-weight webserver for dotnet

## About
WebserverCS is a light-weight webserver created on top of my other library [AdvancedSockets](https://github.com/TheBoneJarmer/AdvancedSockets). It was designed to give more control to the user by allowing them to access and manipulate the http request and responses without too many restrictions. Therefore it is _recommended_ to have a decent knowledge of the HTTP protocol.


## Usage
